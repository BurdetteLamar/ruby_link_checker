Usage: #{$0} [options]

  - Checks links in the Ruby HTML documentation found at #{RubyLinkChecker::BASE_URL}.

  - Writes an HTML file that reports:

    - Onsite pages found.
    - Broken links in onsite pages (including both page not found and fragment not found).
    - Offsite pages found.

  The report is an HTML file in directory ./ruby_link_checker,
  whose filename is timestamp-based with extension .html.

  Option --verbosity controls the quantity of progress messages to be printed.
  The default value is 'minimal'; value 'quiet' suppresses progress messages.

  Options --report-news and --report-legal specify that broken links
  on NEWS and LEGAL pages are to be reported. By default, these are not reported,
  because the Ruby core team has determined that the underlying NEWS and LEGAL
  pages are historical in nature and should not be modified.

  Option --report-github-lines specifies that a line-number fragment on a GitHub page
  is to be reported as not-found. By default, this is not reported.

  Option --help causes the link checker to print its help text, then exit.

  Option --version causes the link checker to print its version, then exit.

  Some options may be of use in developing or debugging the link checker.

  After reading the documentation on the website,
  the link checker writes a "stash" file that contains its findings,
  and from which the report is created.

  The stash file is a JSON file in directory ./ruby_link_checker,
  whose filename is timestamp-based with extension .json.

  Option --report-only specifies that the documentation on the website
  is not to be re-read and that a new stash file is not to be written;
  instead, the report is to be based on the most recent stash file.
  This may be useful in developing or debugging the reporting code
  (avoids repeating the long reading and stashing process).

  Option --verbosity may also be useful for development and debugging.
  Setting the verbosity value to 'debug' tells the link checker to print
  all its progress messages.
